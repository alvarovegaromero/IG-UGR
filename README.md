# Practice 1

In this practice, you are asked to make a cube and a piece of your own choice (in my case an icosahedron). Also, do the methods for coloring pieces in solid and chess mode.

# Practice 2

In this practice three objects are created by revolution: cylinder, cone and sphere.

# Practice 3

We make an articulated object. In my case, an anti-aircraft turret based on "Stationary Anti-Infantry Weapon Type-26" from Halo. The object has several degrees of freedom, plus an extra animation which is a ship that "orbits" around the articulated object.

# Practice 4

This practice is divided into two parts:

  - Calculate the normals to the vertices and faces. Once this is done, add the methods that allow to make flat (concerning the normals of the faces) and soft (concerning the normals to the vertices) illuminations. For the illuminations, there are two lights: one blue and one red (the latter can be moved by an animation). 
  
  - A seminar in which we learn how we can add a texture from an image to a given object. In our case, we make a kind of Christmas tree, where each side has a different color.

# Practice 5

We are asked to implement the selection by color for the sub-pieces that form the articulated object. In addition, by pressing the ';' key we can enter to see the figure through an orthographic projection and by pressing ',' we can return to the original state.
